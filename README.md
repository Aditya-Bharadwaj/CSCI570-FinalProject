# CSCI570 - Final Project
Implementation of Sequence Alignment Algorithms
## Description
---
This project presents two implementations of 2-sequence alignment - a common dynamic programming problem.

The first implementation is a straightforward dynamic programming approach that computes and stores the values of every subproblem in-memory.

The second implementation is a more memory efficient version that integrates both Divide-and-Conquer and Dynamic Programming paradigms without sacrificing on time complexity.

This project was part of CSCI 570 - Analysis of Algorithms course at the University of Southern California.
